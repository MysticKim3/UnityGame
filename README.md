# Idle Game Simulation 
Current state: Only a main menu exists with a basic layout, awaiting button functionality and 4 other scenes that they would redirect to.
### Overview
This project is my attempt at creating a game with 3 modes. First is the idle game which is the main one that users should be interacting with (Solid idea still developing). 
Second is an endless color game that will just create each level randomly, and will provide bonuses for the idle game (the color puzzles will not save).
Lastly, there's a story mode that will use a currency earned in the idle game to unlock new parts.
